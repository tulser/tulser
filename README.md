I'm a software engineer with interests in graphics, real-time programs, and general applications for users.
I primarily use and develop applications on Linux/Unix, particularly Debian and Debian-based systems.
Historically, I have made or helped make real-time applications, mainly in robotics and gerontechnology, making extensive use of Python to create these systems to periodically execute data processing pipelines using sensor information.
