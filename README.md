Hello

I am typically focused in developing native software and user applications for Linux.

Currently, I am either learning about or working on projects involving image/GPU processing, AI, or applications development. Outside of those, I contribute to anything else due to being a dependent user or out of interest.

A (personal) website is in progress.

## Personal TODOs/Goals and Learning:
### In General
* Study machine learning and deep learning concepts to determine how to best use and develop with related libraries/suites such as (Py)Torch.
* Pick up heteregenous computing/GPGPU to make high-performance applications utilizing GPUs/coprocessors.
* Better understand \[Linux\] and its ecosystem, including kernel internals and its facilities/subsystems for userspace management as well as certain programs for administration/management.
 * Namespaces, procfs and sysfs, kernel modules, systemd features (security and hardening ([Using this good reference here](https://gist.github.com/ageis/f5595e59b1cddb1513d1b425a323db04))), compiler specifics, more.
### Languages
* Currently interested in Zig and ecosystem (to \[mostly\] succeed C in usage)
* Currently interested in Rust and ecosystem (to succeed C++ in usage)
### Libraries/Protocols
* Vulkan (and OpenGL)
* SDL
* Heterogenous Computing & GPGPU ecosystems/applications
 * HIP - From what I understand of recent work, this could succeed CUDA due to the largely vendor generic environment/API. Focusing on this.
 * CUDA - Can look at in case HIP seems to remain severely underwhelming in support by NVidia/for NVidia cards.
* Wayland (client + server/compositor)
