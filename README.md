#### Hi, it's Tulser here.

I primarily develop applications and software for Linux using C or C++.

As of now, I'm working on projects (or working towards development) involving image/GPU processing, AI, or applications development.
My current detailed aspirations and interests include:
- Creating and contributing to software on Linux.
  * I want to improve or provide replacements for unmaintained or aging software on Linux, mainly for helping the desktop/user experience space and administration/IT.
  * My goal is to produce or improve memory and processor efficiency in software as well as providing additional simplicity and extensibility.
- Creating dynamic, decision-based systems with artificial intelligence.
  * After observing modern AI and procedural systems in applications such as games and in online demonstrations, I want to create real-time AI using some machine learning in conjunction with other hobby projects, such as videogames or other visual interactibles.
- Utilizing the GPU/Coprocessor for general purpose, high-throughput/efficient computing and real-time processing.
  * I want to use shaders or GPGPUC to develop image filters.
  * In conjunction with the prior goals, determine how to use coprocessors with AI and deep learning.
  * As a hobby, I want to develop a graphical engine based on Vulkan, possibly for animation or games.

I have some personal TODOs for studying concerning the above interests:
* I need to study machine learning and deep learning concepts to better use related libraries such as (Py)Torch.
* For coprocessing and graphics applications, it would help to understand the communication between the host machine and coprocessors/GPUs.
* In conjunction with using AI on general purpose computing platforms through libraries, I may need to run through CUDA or ROCm/OpenCL.
* Better understand and expose myself to facilities provided by [Linux] the kernel and userspace utilities for administration and development, this includes things such as namespaces, procfs and sysfs, systemd features (security and hardening ([Good ref. here](https://gist.github.com/ageis/f5595e59b1cddb1513d1b425a323db04))), compiler specifics, and other things.
