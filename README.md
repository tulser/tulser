Hi, I'm Connor Yates.

I'm a software engineer with interests in project management, graphics, real-time artificial intelligence, and application UI/UX.
I primarily use and develop applications on Linux/Unix, particularly Debian and Debian-based systems.
Historically, I have made or helped make real-time applications, mainly in robotics and gerontechnology, making extensive use of Python to create these systems to periodically execute data processing pipelines using sensor information.
