### Hello,
I primarily develop native applications and software for Linux.

As of now, I'm learning about or working on projects involving image/GPU processing, AI, or applications development as well as a personal website. Outside of those, I contribute to anything else that I have stake in.

## Personal TODOs/Goals and Learning:
### In General
* Study machine learning and deep learning concepts to (better) use related libraries using coprocessor acceleration such as (Py)Torch.
* Pick up heteregenous computing/GPGPU and use libraries/platforms such as HIP with coprocessors such as GPUs.
* Better improve my understanding of \[Linux\], including the kernel internals and its facilities/programs for userspace management.
 * Namespaces, procfs and sysfs, kernel modules, systemd features (security and hardening ([Using this good reference here](https://gist.github.com/ageis/f5595e59b1cddb1513d1b425a323db04))), compiler specifics, more.
### Languages
* Zig (succeeding C in usage)
* Rust (succeeding C++ in usage)
### Libraries/Protocols
* Vulkan
* A little of SDL
* Heterogenous Computing & GPGPU
 * HIP (CUDA-like interface, but open-source for multi-vendor implementation)
* Wayland (client + server)
