### Hello,
I primarily develop native applications and software for Linux.

As of now, I'm learning about or working on projects involving image/GPU processing, AI, or applications development. Outside of that, I contribute to anything else that I have certain stake in.

## Personal TODOs/Goals and Learning:
### In General
* I would like to study machine learning and deep learning concepts to (better) use related libraries using coporcessor acceleration such as (Py)Torch.
* I would like to understand heteregenous computing/GPGPU in order to use libraries/platforms such as HIP with coprocessors such as GPUs.
* Better improve my understanding of the \[Linux\] kernel as well as the usage of its facilities by the userspace administration/services environment.
 * Includes namespaces, procfs and sysfs, kernel modules, systemd features (security and hardening ([Using this good reference here](https://gist.github.com/ageis/f5595e59b1cddb1513d1b425a323db04))), compiler specifics, etc.
### Languages
* Zig (replacing C study/development as a focus)
* Rust (replacing C++ study/development as a focus)
### Libraries/Protocols
* Vulkan
* A little of SDL
* Heterogenous Computing & GPGPU
 * HIP (CUDA-like interface, but open-source for multi-vendor implementation)
* Wayland (client + server)
